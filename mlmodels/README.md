# mlmodels
Various machine learning models integrated with bayesian/random search using hyperopt


## Applications

1- Image to molecule translation
- https://github.com/HamdiTarek/LG_SMILES_1st
- https://github.com/testmailtt/LG_SMILES_2nd
- Detect atoms and bonds from the image and translate to SMILES notation.

2- Segmentation
- Mask RCNN, Instance segmentation: https://research.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/maskrcnn.pdf
